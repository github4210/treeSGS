# treeSGS
Tree-guided sparse group selection

To run treeSGS algorithm, SLEP package is required. Details can be found http://www.yelab.net/software/SLEP/
We also provided with name SLEP_package_4.1.zip. 

Input data: Hapmap_CNV_processed2.mat

fulldatatest_step1_TBL5.m runs treeSGS_b algorithm and fulldatatest_step2_TBL5.m plots coeeficient matrix V.
fulldatatest_step1_TBL6.m and fulldatatest_step2_TBL6.m are corresponding to treeSGS_g algorithm.
